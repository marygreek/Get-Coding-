<h1>BUDGETING FOR EVERYONE</h1>
<h2>Why I chose this project</h2>
<p>Financial literacy is the cornerstone of a secure and prosperous future. In a rapidly changing economic landscape, understanding how money works isn't just a skill â€“ it's a necessity. Financial literacy empowers individuals to make informed decisions about budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. It enables you to navigate complex financial markets, avoid pitfalls, and seize opportunities. With the right knowledge, you can plan for retirement, weather unexpected expenses, and achieve your long-term aspirations. Financial literacy isn't just about numbers; it's about gaining the confidence and competence to control your financial destiny. Whether you're starting your first job or nearing retirement, the benefits of financial literacy resonate at every stage of life.  </p>
<h2>What I want to accomplish</h2>
<p>This goal of this project is to gently guide the user through the process of answering a series of questions about their expenses and income.
Once all questions have been answered, a budget based on a pre-defined template, will be populated. 
This budget will be displayed monthly, and the user will also be able to view all future budgets.
<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p>In the future I would like to add some additional features <br>
<ul>
  <li> A simplified budget template that can be used in schools for teaching students.</li>
  <li> An investment add on so people can review all of their investments in one place.</li>
  <li> A Learning centre which holds information and resources for budgeting and investing. </li>
  <li> Integration with financial institutions so budgets can be aligned with accounts. </li>
  <li> A goal planner that helps align expenses with Canadian living standards.</li>
</ul>
